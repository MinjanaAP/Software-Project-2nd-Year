# Software-Project-2nd-Year
Project Name: Emporia. This Project allows users to post ads while administrators manage and filter them efficiently. Built with Laravel (backend) and HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery, and AJAX (frontend), it features an API-driven architecture and a dynamic admin panel.  We collaborated with Nemo Technologies (Pvt) Ltd for this project.
